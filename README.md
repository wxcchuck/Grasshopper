# Grasshopper
This repository contains grasshopper scripts I have made to facilitate parametric design, environmental analysis and graphic outputs.

The purpose of this repository is to share and distribute files under the MIT License, hopefully to help a user solve similar problems.

This is an evolving repository where scripts will be added, updated and maintained from my experience as a computation designer and environmental analyst.

This repository does not contain any copyright materials owned by Pilbrow & Partners - the practice I am currently working for.

## **CAT.1 Parametric design** 
This category contains scripts that evaluate, optimise and generate designs based on given parameters.

Current list of scripts:

## **CAT.2 Environmental analysis**
This category contains scripts to undertake different types of environmental analysis in the context of urban planning. The files are named after the country codes (as specified in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:pub:PUB500001:en) followed by particular regulation (or regulating body) and the name of analysis. 

As building regulations and guidelines vary from country to country, this category will initially focus on the UK, Sweden and China which I have gained experience in. However, I am also very curious about other country specificities and I am open to requests.

Current list of scripts:

GB-BRE-Sunlight On Ground

GB-BRE-Daylight factor

## **CAT.3 Graphics**
This category contains scripts that create graphic contents - images and animations - without the necessity of using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop or Premiere Pro.
