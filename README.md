# Grasshopper
This repository contains grasshopper scripts I have made to facilitate parametric design, environmental analysis and graphic outputs.

The purpose of this repository is to share and distribute files under the MIT License, hopefully to help a user solve similar problems.

This is an evolving repository where scripts will be added, updated and maintained from my experience as a computation designer and environmental analyst.

This repository does not contain any copyright materials owned by Pilbrow & Partners - the practice I am currently working for.

## **001_Parametric design** 
This category contains scripts that evaluate, optimise and generate designs based on given parameters.

Current list of scripts (in sub-categories of evaluation, optimisation and generation):
#### Evaluation
* Building heights heatmap
* Rebuilding window surfaces (from Brep)
* Area schedule given a massing

#### Optimisation
* Fillet within a given range of angels and/or fillet length

#### Generation
* Wall to ceiling cladding

## **002_Environmental analysis**
This category contains scripts to undertake different types of environmental analysis in the context of urban planning. The files are named after the country codes (as specified in [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:pub:PUB500001:en) followed by particular regulation (or regulating body) and the name of analysis. 

As building regulations and guidelines vary from country to country, this category will initially focus on the UK, Sweden and China which I have gained experience in. However, I am also very curious about other country specificities and I am open to requests.

Current list of scripts:

* ...
* CN-
* GB-BRE-Sunlight On Ground
* GB-BRE-Daylight factor
* GB-BRE-Daylight illuminance
* SE-BBR-Dagsljusfaktor
* SE-BBR-Direkt sol p√• fasad
* ...


## **003_Graphics**
This category contains scripts that create graphic contents to further produce images and animations in Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, etc,. 

Current list of scripts (in chronological order of creation):
* 2022 Christmas greetings
* 2023 Lunar New year greetings (Year of Rabbit)
* 2023 Lantern Festival greetings
